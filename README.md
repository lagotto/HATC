## Gaols for (H)ash (A)lgorithm for (T)ext (C)omparison
Create a prototype method for specifying a reproducible hash of text content. Goals:

* Allow publishing of an Hash that allows comparison of a text when the actual content 
isn't available. 

* Allow parties who didn't create the hash to reliably reproduce the hash.

* The hash should allow comparison of subsections of the text.

* Finally this is just attempt demonstrate a concept. The assumption if this proves 
worthwhile other experts are likely to reimplement using more effecent algorithms.
